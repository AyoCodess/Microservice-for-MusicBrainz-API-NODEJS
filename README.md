## The Task

ðŸ˜Š As a 60-minute challenge, I was asked to...

"Build a small JavaScript/Node.js backend service with just 1 endpoint (The service) using artists Ids.

The service will consume artist Id GET requests from the MusicBrainz API."

I also deployed my API which was not part of the task. In actual fact, figuring out how to deploy my API took longer than coding the API itself.
