# Microservice-for-MusicBrainz-API-NODEJS

## Tech stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-

## Getting started

- `npm install`
- `nodemon api`
- open up localhost:3002 to view the API

## The exercise

We would like you to build a small JavaScript/Node.js backend service with just 1 endpoint(The service).
The service will consume the MusicBrainz API.

You're free to use any package you want to build the service. However we would like you to build the request to MusicBrainz yourself with Fetch, Axios or other package that makes barebone request.

Spend around 60 min building your service. Absolutely not more than 120 minutes.
